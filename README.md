Fashion Product Categorization using
RAG

Fashion Product Categorization using RAG is a project aimed at developing a
system that utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
categorize fashion products into specific sub-categories and retrieve their
mandatory attributes. The system employs the Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) model, which combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches
to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses.
Fashion products often belong to various sub-categories such as shirts, t-shirts,
sweatshirts, etc., each with its own set of mandatory attributes. Identifying the
correct sub-category and its associated mandatory attributes is crucial for
effective product management, inventory tracking, and customer satisfaction.
By leveraging the RAG model, this project offers an intelligent solution for
automating the categorization process and retrieving relevant product attributes
based on a given taxonomy. Users can input the name of a fashion product, and
the system will generate a response containing the corresponding sub-category
and its mandatory attributes.
The primary goals of this project include:
Providing an intuitive user interface for querying fashion product information.
Harnessing the power of NLP models like RAG to accurately categorize products
and retrieve attributes.
Enhancing the efficiency of fashion product management and
classification processes.
